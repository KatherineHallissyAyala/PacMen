# PacMen
User can create pacmen and start them moving in random directions and at random velocities.  When they reach a border of the screen, they change direction, effectively bouncing off the walls.
# Installation
Run in a browser.  Make sure to include all files, including image files.
# Usage
When the page loads, the user will see two buttons and no Pacman images.  Clicking the "New Pacman" button creates a new Pacman in a randomized location.  Clicking the "Game Time!" button starts the Pacmen moving, in random directions at random speeds.
