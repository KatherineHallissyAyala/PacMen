# PacMen
In this PacMEN project, the user can create many Pacman instances and start them moving in random directions and at random velocities.  When they reach a border of the screen, they change direction, effectively bouncing off the walls.  This project uses Javascript to manipulate the DOM's HTML divs.
# How to Run
Open the HTML file in a browser.  Make sure all files, including image files, are stored in the same directory as the HTML file.
# Usage
When the page loads, the user will see two buttons and no Pacman images.  Clicking the "New Pacman" button creates a new Pacman in a randomized location, with each click.  Clicking the "Game Time!" button starts all of the Pacmen moving, in random directions at random speeds.
# Support
You can email any questions to me at info@codebykatherine.com
# Roadmap for future improvements
I worked on this project in a Fullstack Developer certification course.  It would be fun to add randomized colors to the Pacmen created by clicking the New Pacman button.  It might be helful to add a Stop Pacmen button.
